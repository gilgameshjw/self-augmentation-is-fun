The combined weight of those ants is more than all of the wild birds and mammals on the planet.\nThe weight is also equal to about one-fifth of the total weight of humans. Scientists say the findings,\npublished\nMonday in the peer-reviewed Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, are "conservative."\nAnts are present in nearly all ecosystems around the planet, thanks to their extremely social nature. At the moment, there are more than 15,700 named species and subspecies, but there are many others not yet named.\nTo come up with the total, researchers analyzed 489 studies from around the world, spanning all continents and major habitats. Other scientists had the tedious task of directly observing and counting ants through traps and leaf samples — and then their research was combined to reach the 20,000,000,000,000,000 estimate.\nScientists say that\'s between two and 20 times higher than prior estimates.\nResearchers also wanted to work out the total weight of all the ants. They concluded an estimated "biomass" of about 12 million tons of carbon. But carbon only makes up about half the dry weight of an ant — meaning that the total mass is likely even higher.\nResearchers at the University of Hong Kong found there are 20,000,000,000,000,000 ants on the planet.\nIf the weight of all of those ants were added together, they would weigh more than all of the mammals on Earth.\npic.twitter.com/y4WXvMq5uv\n— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings)\nSeptember 20, 2022\nResearchers found ants are not evenly distributed around the planet; rather, they peak in the tropics, highlighting the importance of those regions as the climate changes. They were also abundant in both forests and arid regions.\nAll of these ants, of course, serve a crucial role in our ecosystems. The insects aerate the soil, spread seeds, break down organic material and create habitats for other animals. They are also an important part of the food chain, scientists note, and can be more effective than pesticides for farmers.\nSome animal species are unable to survive without ants, including some birds, which rely on them to find prey, and countless plant species that either feed or house the insects in exchange for protection or spreading of seeds.\nBut they are under severe threat, due to habitat destruction and fragmentation, chemical use, invasive species and\nclimate change\n.\n"It\'s in humanity\'s interest to monitor ant populations," scientists say. "Counting\nants\nis not difficult, and citizen scientists from all over the world could help investigate how these important animals are faring at a time of great environmental change."\nScientists admitted that there were several limitations to the findings, however. The locations from their samples were not evenly distributed in terms of geographic regions, and most were collected from the ground, leaving much to be learned about populations in trees or underground.\nBut researchers still hope these findings can provide a critical baseline from which ant populations can be monitored in the future, amid concerning environmental changes.\nMore from CBS News\nMap shows measles cases across U.S.\nSaving Nevada\'s dark skies - one license plate at a time\nDozens of workers missing after avalanche sweeps away their camp\nHow much will a $5,000 long-term CD earn now?\nTranscript: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on "Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan," March 2, 2025\nIn:\nHong Kong\nClimate Change\nScience\nSophie Lewis\nSophie Lewis is a social media manager and trending content writer for CBS News.\nMore from CBS News\nMap shows measles cases across U.S.\nSaving Nevada\'s dark skies - one license plate at a time\nDozens of workers missing after avalanche sweeps away their camp\nHow much will a $5,000 long-term CD earn now?\nView CBS News In\nCBS News App\nOpen\nChrome\nSafari\nContinue\nBe the first to know\nGet browser notifications for breaking news, live events, and exclusive reporting.\nNot Now\nTurn On', 'image_urls': [], 'title': '\n    20,000,000,000,000,000 ants are crawling around Earth, researchers find, weighing more in total than all birds and mammals combined - CBS News'}, {'url': 'https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29281253', 'raw_content': 'Are all the ants as heavy as all the humans? - BBC News\nImage source,\nThinkstock\nBy Hannah Moore\nBBC News\n"If we were to weigh all the ants in the world, they would weigh as much as all of the people," said wildlife presenter Chris Packham recently in BBC Four\'s The Wonder Of Animals: Ants. But is this statement true?\nThis claim was originally made by Harvard University professor Edward O Wilson, and the German biologist Bert Hoelldobler, in their 1994 book Journey To The Ants.\nThey based their estimate on an earlier one by British entomologist C B Williams, who once calculated that the number or insects alive on earth at a given moment was one million trillion.\n"If, to take a conservative figure, one percent of this host is ants, their total population is ten thousand trillion," wrote Wilson and Hoelldobler. "Individual workers weigh on average between 1 to 5 mg, according to the species. When combined, all ants in the world taken together weigh about as much as all human beings."\nWilson and Hoelldobler\'s calculation is based on the idea that the average human weighs a million times more than the average ant. So how well does that stand up to scrutiny? The average adult human weighs 62kg, so that would make the average ant about 60mg.\n"There are ants that weigh 60mg, but they\'re really the big ants," says Francis Ratnieks, Professor of Apiculture at the University of Sussex.\n"The common ants which live in British gardens weigh about 1mg or 2mg."\nHow do you weigh an ant?\nImage source,\nGetty Images\n"It\'s very easy to weigh an ant. You buy a small electronic balance, and you place the ant on the balance," says Ratnieks. But he advises you refrigerate it first. "That way it doesn\'t run away."\nAnother option is to weigh them in a group, says Mike Fox from BWARS: "I would simply take a suitable container such as a specimen tube and weigh it empty, then put in a counted number of ants, say 100. Weigh again. Deduct the weight of the empty tube and divide it by the number of ants."\nDiscover more about the structured social system of ants\nWith around 13,000 species worldwide, ranging in length from less than 1mm to 30mm, it\'s probable their weights vary greatly - though most experts seem to agree the average weight of an ant is less than 10mg.\nBut no-one knows how many ants there are in the world. The BBC Four documentary claims they number not 10,000 trillion but 100 trillion, though it still suggests the total weight of ants equals the total weight of humans.\nExperts from the Natural History Museum, Bristol University\'s Ant Lab, and BWARS (Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society), among others, say there is no realistic estimate.\nEven by Wilson and Hoelldobler\'s own figures, their calculation is wrong. There are 7.2 billion humans on the planet today - if we take everyone over the age of 15, they weigh a combined total of about 332bn kg. If we imagine there are 10,000 trillion ants in the world, weighing an average of 4mg, their total weight comes to just 40bn kg.\nIf we allow for the smaller human population at the time they wrote their book, and a slightly lower average weight, they are still a long way out.\nBut Ratnieks believes Wilson and Hoelldobler\'s claim - though untrue in relation to today\'s world population - would have once been accurate.\n"I think if we went back 2,000 years, certainly the ants would\'ve outweighed the humans... but at roughly the time that America became independent [1776], or a little bit before that, that\'s when we humans became more impressive in our weight than the ants," he says.\n"We must also remember that humans are getting fatter all the time. We\'re not just increasing in population, we\'re increasing in fatness, so I think we\'ve left the ants behind."\nImage source,\nThinkstock\nListen to More or Less on BBC Radio 4 and the World Service, or download the free\npodcast\n.\nYou can watch\nThe Wonder Of Animals: Ants\non\niPlayer\n.\nSubscribe to the\nBBC News Magazine\'s email newsletter\nto get articles sent to your inbox.\nTop stories\nStarmer announces \'coalition of the willing\' to guarantee Ukraine peace\nPublished\n29 minutes ago\nZelensky bruised but upbeat after diplomatic whirlwind\nPublished\n3 hours ago\nLive\n.Â\nAnora sweeps Oscars with best picture, best director and best actress for Mikey Madison\nMore to explore\nThe full list of Oscar winners and nominees\nStarmer is helping to shape talks on Ukraine but the path to peace could be long\n\'New Ukraine peace deal\' and Zelensky\'s \'king-size welcome\'\nThe \'Time Lords\' racing to tackle the threat of GPS jamming\nSwitzerland targets rich tourists but at what cost?\nDiversity backlash: Is \'masculine energy\' coming to the UK?\nLady Gaga is back, and Jennie\'s debut solo album is here: What to stream this week\nIts tower was once sold for scrap but this seaside town is \'on the up\'\nThe Upbeat newsletter: Start your week on a high with uplifting stories delivered to your inbox\nElsewhere on the BBC\nA new, fierce, vibrant and gripping period drama\nAs WWI ends, housewife Kate Galloway sets up a nightclub in Soho to support her daughters\nThe Mayor of London joins Fatiha to talk about Ramadan\nTogether, they debunk some myths around the month\nActor Bryan Cranston traces his fatherâ\x80\x99s family line\nLost connections and unknown histories are revealed as Bryan traces his family trees\nWhy do we feel connected to certain places?\nExploring our connections to folk stories, songs and landmarks across the UK\nMost read\n1\nA payback kiss, a surprise win, and defying gravity at the Oscars\n2\nUK death rate \'reaches record low\'\n3\nStarmer announces \'coalition of the willing\' to guarantee Ukraine peace\n4\n\'New Ukraine peace deal\' and Zelensky\'s \'king-size welcome\'\n5\nZelensky bruised but upbeat after diplomatic whirlwind\n6\nThe full list of Oscar winners and nominees\n7\nStars turn on the style on Oscars red carpet - in pictures\n8\nCancer family \'financially broken\' by benefits wait\n9\nMinisters outline plans to ban new leasehold flats\n10\nDiversity backlash: Is \'masculine energy\' coming to the UK?', 'image_urls': [], 'title': 'Are all the ants as heavy as all the humans? - BBC News'}, {'url': 'https://thefactbase.com/all-the-ants-on-earth-weigh-about-as-much-as-all-the-humans/', 'raw_content': 'All the ants on earth weigh about as much as all the humans | The Fact Base\nHome\nOur Team\nContact\nAll the ants on earth weigh about as much as all the humans\nBy\nMorgan Wallace\nPublished in\nAnimals\nFebruary 02, 2024\n2\nmin read\nAll the ants on Earth weigh about as much as all the humans.\nAnts, these tiny creatures that are often seen as a nuisance, play a significant role in the overall weight of living organisms on our planet. Surprisingly, the combined weight of all the ants on Earth is about equal to the weight of all the humans. This intriguing fact highlights the incredible numbers and remarkable capabilities of these minuscule insects.\nAnts, belonging to the insect order Hymenoptera, have a global distribution and can be found in almost every ecosystem on Earth. With over 12,000 known species, ants have successfully colonized various habitats, from deserts to rainforests and from cities to remote islands. They are highly social insects, living in large colonies with complex social structures.\nDue to their small size, ants may not individually weigh much, but their sheer numbers make a significant impact. Estimates suggest that there are trillions upon trillions of ants on Earth, with some studies suggesting that the number could potentially reach one million ants per human. This massive population contributes to the overall weight of ants, making it equal to the weight of mankind.\nAnts have an extraordinary ability to organize themselves into complex societies, establishing intricate networks of tunnels and chambers within their colonies. These networks allow ants to efficiently forage for food, care for their young, and defend their territories. The combined effort and cooperation of thousands or even millions of ants greatly contribute to their overall success as a species.\nAside from their impressive numerical strength, ants also play crucial roles in ecosystems. They act as scavengers, consuming dead organic matter and helping in the process of decomposition. Some ant species are effective predators, controlling populations of other insects and thereby maintaining a balanced ecosystem.\nAnts are also proficient agriculturalists. Certain species cultivate fungus as their primary food source, effectively creating their miniature farms. They forage for plant material, bring it back to their colonies, and use it to cultivate fungus gardens. In some instances, ants even rear aphids, protecting and milking them for the sugary secretions they produce.\nIn conclusion, the fact that all the ants on Earth weigh about as much as all the humans is a testament to both the astonishing numbers and the immense contributions of ants to our planet. These tiny creatures, despite their size, play a crucial role in ecosystems, maintaining balance and aiding in the process of decomposition. So, the next time you spot an ant scurrying across the ground, remember the extraordinary weight they collectively hold on Earth.\nSource:\nBBC: How many ants are there on the planet?\nTags\n#General\n#Animals\nShare\nPrevious Article\nAll the blinking in one day equates to having your eyes closed for 30 minutes\nNext Article\nAll radios in north korea have been rigged so listeners can only receive a north korean government station\nMorgan Wallace\nPolitical journalist\nRelated Posts\n3 new species of deepwater sharks found by scientists near new zealand glow in the dark their green glow or bioluminescence helps other sharks identify each other\nElizabeth Marshall\nFebruary 02, 2024\n1\nmin\n400 quarter pounders can be made from 1 cow\nDana Jordan\nFebruary 02, 2024\n2\nmin\nA bear has 42 teeth\nElizabeth Marshall\nFebruary 02, 2024\n2\nmin\nA cat has 32 muscles in each ear\nElizabeth Marshall\nFebruary 02, 2024\n1\nmin\n90 of male giraffes mate with other males scientists have found it isn t about sexual orientation adult giraffes mate with female giraffes as well\nMorgan Wallace\nFebruary 02, 2024\n2\nmin\nA cat can t climb head first down a tree because every claw on a cat s paw points the same way to get down from a tree a cat must back down\nDana Jordan\nFebruary 02, 2024\n2\nmin\n©\n2024\n, All Rights Reserved.\nQuick Links\nAdvertise with us\nAbout Us\nContact Us\nLegal Stuff\nPrivacy Notice\nCookie Policy\nTerms Of Use\nSocial Media\ntwitter\ninstagram', 'image_urls': [], 'title': 'All the ants on earth weigh about as much as all the humans | The Fact Base'}, {'url': 'https://modernsciences.org/earth-harbours-20000000000000000-ants-and-they-weigh-more-than-wild-birds-and-mammals-combined/', 'raw_content': 'Earth harbours 20,000,000,000,000,000 ants – and they weigh more than wild birds and mammals combined - Modern Sciences\nNature\nEarth harbours 20,000,000,000,000,000 ants – and they weigh more than wild birds and mammals combined\nby\nMark Wong\nOctober 3, 2022\n4 minute read\nShutterstock\nMark Wong\n,\nThe University of Western Australia\n;\nBenoit Guénard\n,\nUniversity of Hong Kong\n;\nFrançois Brassard\n,\nCharles Darwin University\n;\nPatrick Schultheiss\n,\nJulius Maximilian University of Würzburg\n;\nRunxi Wang\n,\nUniversity of Hong Kong\n, and\nSabine Nooten\n,\nJulius Maximilian University of Würzburg\nHave you ever wondered exactly how many ants live on Earth? Possibly not, but it’s certainly a question we’ve asked ourselves.\nOur\nresearch\npublished today provides an approximate answer. We conservatively estimate our planet harbours about 20 quadrillion ants. That’s 20 thousand million millions, or in numerical form, 20,000,000,000,000,000 (20 with 15 zeroes).\nWe further estimate the world’s ants collectively constitute about 12 million tonnes of dry carbon. This exceeds the mass of all the world’s wild birds and wild mammals combined. It’s also equal to about one-fifth of the total weight of humans.\nEminent biologist Edward O. Wilson once said insects and other invertebrates are “the little things that run the world” – and he was right. Ants, in particular, are a crucial\npart\nof nature. Among other roles, ants aerate the soil, disperse seeds, break down organic material, create habitat for other animals and form an important part of the food chain.\nEstimating ant numbers and mass provides an important baseline from which to monitor ant populations amid worrying environmental changes.\nMany ant species are important seed dispersers.

Ants’ high degree of social organisation has enabled them to colonise nearly all ecosystems and regions around the globe.\nThe astounding ubiquity of ants has prompted many naturalists to\ncontemplate\ntheir exact number on Earth. But these were basically educated guesses. Systematic, evidence-based estimates have been lacking.\nOur research involved an analysis of 489 studies of ant populations conducted by fellow ant scientists from around the world. This included non-English literature, in languages such as Spanish, French, German, Russian, Mandarin and Portuguese.\nThe research spanned all continents and major habitats including forests, deserts, grasslands and cities. They used standardised methods for collecting and counting ants such as pitfall traps and leaf litter samples. As you can imagine, this is often tedious work.\nA researcher installs a pitfall trap, a standard method for collecting ants that crawl across the ground surface.\nFrancois Brassard\nFrom all this, we estimate there are approximately 20 quadrillion ants on Earth. This figure, though conservative, is between two and 20 times higher than previous estimates.\nTh previous figures employed a “top-down” approach by assuming ants comprise about 1% of the world’s estimated insect population. In contrast, our “bottom-up” estimate is more reliable because it uses data on ants observed directly in the field and makes fewer assumptions.\nOur next step was to work out how much all these ants weigh. The mass of organisms is\ntypically measured\nin terms of their carbon makeup. We estimated that 20 quadrillion average-sized ants corresponds to a dry weight or “biomass” of approximately 12 million tonnes of carbon.\nThis is more than the combined biomass of wild birds and mammals – and about 20% of total human biomass.\nCarbon makes up\nabout half\nthe dry weight of an ant. If the weight of other bodily elements was included, the total mass of the world’s ants would be higher still.\nWe also found ants are distributed unevenly on Earth’s surface. They vary sixfold between habitats and generally peak in the tropics. This underscores the importance of tropical regions in maintaining healthy ant populations.\nAnts were also particularly abundant in forests, and surprisingly, in arid regions. But they become less common in human-made habitats.\nOur findings come with a few caveats. For example, the sampling locations in our dataset are unevenly distributed across geographic regions. And the vast majority of samples were collected from the ground layer, meaning we have very little information about ant numbers in trees or\nunderground\n. This means our findings are somewhat incomplete.\nThe new research found ants are distributed unevenly on Earth’s surface.\nShutterstock\nWe all need ants\nAnts also provide vital “ecosystem services” for humans. For instance, a recent study\nfound\nants can be more effective than pesticides at helping farmers produce food.\nAnts have also developed tight interactions with other organisms – and some species cannot survive without them.\nFor example, some birds rely on ants to\nflush out\ntheir prey.

Counting ants is not difficult, and citizen scientists from all over the world could help investigate how these important animals are faring at a time of great environmental change.\nRead more:\nWhy tiny ants have invaded your house, and what to do about it\nClimate change\nAnts\nInsects\nTropics\nInvertebrates\nBiodiversity loss\nEvents\nMore events\nJobs\nResearch Fellow in Plant Biochemistry\nHead of Institute Te Kura o Te Mātauranga – Institute of Education\nChair of Counselling, ACAP University College\nSenior Lecturer/ Associate Professor in Cyber Security\nSenior Lecturer / Associate Professor in Midwifery\nMore jobs\n\u200b\n\u200b\n\u200b', 'image_urls': [], 'title': 'Earth harbours 20,000,000,000,000,000 ants – and they weigh more than wild birds and mammals combined'}, {'url': 'https://www.timesnownews.com/technology-science/study-finds-there-are-2-5-million-ants-per-human-on-earth-with-a-biomass-larger-than-all-bird-and-mammals-combined-article-94342372', 'raw_content': 'Study finds there are 2.5 million ants per human on Earth, with a biomass larger than all bird and mammals combined | Technology & Science News, Times Now\nOpen Popup\nTrending:\nOscar Awards 2025\nIndia vs New Zealand\nDream11 Prediction\nPaytm ED Notice\nPune Rape Case\nCUET UG 2025 Date\nRahul Gandhi\nChampions Trophy 2025\nnews\ntechnology & science\nStudy finds there are 2.5 million ants per human on Earth, with a biomass larger than all bird and mammals combined\nThe research was based on 489 studies, spanning all continents, biomes, and habitats. Using this data, the researchers estimated the total number of ants to be 20 quadrillions.\nTN Science Desk\nUpdated Sep 21, 2022, 10:47 IST\nWhile we have all wondered how many Ants are there on Earth, Scientists now have an estimate and it\'s mind-boggling. A\nnew study\nputs the number to be around 20 quadrillion ants on Earth, roughly around 2.5 million ants for every human.\n“Anyone who’s looked at ants and realized there are lots of them has probably wondered how many there may be in total – it’s just a question that’s on people’s minds,” says Patrick Schultheiss at the University of Hong Kong, who co-led the study with his colleague Sabine Nooten at the Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg in Germany.\nThe research was based on 489 studies, spanning all continents, biomes, and habitats. Using this data, the researchers estimated the total number of ants to be 20 quadrillions.\nThe total biomass of this global ant population – the collective weight of carbon in all individuals – is about 12 million tonnes. This is more than wild birds and mammals combined, which have total biomass of 2 million tonnes and 7 million tonnes, respectively. Humans, by comparison, have total biomass of 60 million tonnes.\nThe researchers noted that the abundances of ground-dwelling ants are strongly concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions but vary substantially across habitats. The density of leaf-litter ants is highest in forests, while the numbers of actively ground-foraging ants are highest in arid regions.\nPrevious estimates of the number of ants on Earth were “essentially educated guesses” that extrapolated from ant densities measured in one or two locations, says Schultheiss. The latest analysis aimed to be more accurate by looking at studies from all continents and written in different languages.\n"Our results provide a crucial baseline for exploring environmental drivers of ant-abundance patterns and for tracking the responses of insects to environmental change."\nLatest News\nPrevious\nindia\nPolitical Row Over Rohit Sharma\'s Weight As Congress Leader Defends \'Fat\' Remark: \'Attacked For No Reason\'\nentertainment news\nShakira POSTPONES Sold Out Chile Concert Citing Stage Concerns, Pens Note For Fans \'Unfortunately, We\'ve Found...\'\nlifestyle\nInternational Women’s Day 2025: A Complete Gift Guide For Women\ndelhi\nHow Delhi Got Its Name-A King\'s Legacy Or A Divine Connection?\nbusiness economy\nReliance Industries Share Price Hits A 52-Week Low, Falls 3%: What Is Causing The Market Blues?\nlifestyle\nWomen\'s Day 2025: How 9 Chefs Are Reviving Regional Cuisines In India\neducation\nSarkari Naukri This Week: Apply Online For Indian Overseas Bank, India Post, AIIMS Nursing Officer and Other Posts\nlifestyle\n10 Non-Fiction Books That Explain Why the World Feels So Broken Right Now\nNext\npatrick schultheiss\nuniversity of hong kong\nAnts\nquadrillion\nEarth\nmammals\nhuman\nMaximilian University of Würzburg\nscience\nbiomass\nTrending:\nLive Cricket Score\nMunicipal Elections Haryana\nMumbai To Goa\nCUET UG 2025\nSouth Africa vs England\nTN Science Desk\nauthor\nProfessionals & enthusiasts who write about politics to science, from economy to education, from local issues to national events and global affairs, t...\nView More\nEnd of Article\nSubscribe to our daily Newsletter!\nSubmit\nLive TV\nShows\nRelated News\nYoung cold-blooded animals are suffering the most as Earth heats up, research finds\nAbandoned mansion goes viral after Google Maps users notice unsettling details while using Street View\niOS 19 Release Date, Compatible iPhones, New AI Features, Major Upgrades, Leaks, What We Expect At WWDC 2025\nAI Will Influence PC Buying Decisions Over Next Few Years: Lenovo’s Gregory Beh\nApple May Launch New iPads, M4 MacBook Air Models This Month: What To Expect', 'image_urls': [], 'title': 'Study finds there are 2.5 million ants per human on Earth, with a biomass larger than all bird and mammals combined | Technology & Science News, Times Now'}, {'url': 'https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/world/475191/researchers-calculate-there-are-2-point-5-million-ants-for-every-human', 'raw_content': 'Researchers calculate there are 2.5 million ants for every human | RNZ News\nNavigation for News Categories\nBy\nWill Dunham\nResearchers estimate there are 20 quadrillion ants on the planet.\nPhoto:\nFaris Algosaibi / CC BY 2.0\nThe world\'s human population is forecast to surpass 8 billion in the coming months.

And are all the ants as heavy as the humankind?\nDate: 14.10.2022\nHow many ants live in the world? And are all the ants as heavy as the humankind?\nA recent study in the prestigious American journal PNAS by Schultheiss and colleagues has refined estimates of how many ants live in the world and how much they weigh. It estimated that they are approximately 2.5 million worker ants for every human, and all of the ants in the world weigh as much as a fifth of the human population on Earth. The study was followed up by a comment in the same journal by researchers Tom Fayle and Petr Klimeš from the Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences (BC CAS), who introduced how estimates of the abundance and biomass (carbon weight) of ants have changed over time, and pointed out that we still do not know the abundance of insects as a whole. Ants are thus one of the few invertebrates for which new research has made such estimates possible. However, according to Fayle and Klimeš, we still have to wait for more accurate numbers, and it is likely that ant numbers and biomass are even larger.\nThe decline of insects is one of the big problems of today, but how many individuals of insects share our planet with us is still unknown. Most of the claims are based on a very rough estimate, according to which the global insect population is 10\n18\nindividuals, but the reliability of this estimate cannot yet be empirically verified. Nevertheless, the question remained of whether we can refine our abundance estimates for at least some groups of insects. Ants - a socially living and ecologically significant group - belong to the most prominent representatives of insects with large populations. And it was this group of insects who were made famous by biologist Edward O. Wilson, who compared their weight to the weight of all the humans. However, this consideration, like all previous studies, was based on the rough estimate of the total number of insects. Schultheiss et al. for the first time based their calculations on actual measured numbers of ant workers in leaf-litter, collected from hundreds of studies from most habitats of the world. This most recent work estimated the total population of worker ants at 2 × 10\n16\n(20 quadrillion), equivalent to 20% of current human biomass (\nGraph\n).\nGraph\n. Changes in estimates of (A) abundance of individuals and (B) weight of dry biomass in megatons of carbon (Mt C) of ants. In red on the right is the most recent range of estimates from Schultheiss et al. (2022). The known or estimated total global biomasses of other groups, including humans, are indicated on the right. Literary sources to create the image are available in the article Fayle T. M., Klimeš P. (2022).\nBut is it possible that the ant abundance and biomass is greater and Wilson was not mistaken in his rough estimate? Tom Fayle and Petr Klimeš point out that these new estimates do not take into account species living in the soil and ant queens and brood. It is also not clear how the current estimates would change if differences in the weight of individual ants between different species could be taken into account in future calculations, rather than just using an estimate of the weight of the average ant. Ant species vary dramatically in body size and for many species this is true even within a single colony. Similarly, the colonies themselves vary in size, but their numbers are largely unknown. While counting individual ants in leaf-litter has proven feasible, counting nests on a global scale is not yet possible. The total biomass of ants is thus probably even greater. On the other hand, it is likely that current calculations, on the contrary, overestimate the number of ants in some places of the planet, since they concentrated on natural habitats at the expense of rapidly expanding non-native habitats.\nWe will have to wait for more accurate estimates. However, it is already apparent and somewhat alarming that neither ants (range of all estimates 3.6 – 50 Mt) nor humans (60 Mt) achieve such huge biomass weights as domestic animals (100 Mt carbon). Even so, the weight of ants and humans far exceeds the weight of, for example, all wild birds (\nGraph\n). The next step in today's rapidly changing world is thus a deeper understanding of how the abundance and biomass of insects and other organisms differ between natural and altered landscapes.\nMany species of ants show polymorphism in the body size of workers. An extreme case is in the genus\nCarebara\n, where tiny yellow workers and giant dark workers (soldiers) live side by side in the same colony, and differ in their dry weight by approximately five hundred times. Photo of\nCarebara affinis\n, Papua New Guinea (by Philipp Otto Hönle).\nThe huge biomass of ants can even support the biomass of other ant species, for example specialized ant hunters. An example of this strategy are army ants of the genus\nAenictus\nthat steal brood from other ants and accumulate them to feed their own brood later.

The total human population in the world is approximately 6.84 billion, and it is estimated there are currently about 10,000 trillion ants alive.\n1\nBased on these values, how does the total the total mass of all living ants compare to the total mass of all living humans?\n1: Holldobler, B., E. Wilson,\nJourney to the Ants: A Story of Scientific Exploration\n(London, England: The Belknap Press of Harvard University, 1994).\nCommentary\nThis task requires students to work with very large and small values expressed both in scientific notation and in decimal notation (standard form). In addition, students need to convert units of mass. The solution below converts the mass of humans into grams; however, we could just as easily converted the mass of ants into kilograms. Students are unable to go directly to a calculator without taking into account all of the considerations mentioned above. Even after converting units and decimals to scientific notation, students should be encouraged to use the structure of scientific notation to regroup the products by extending the properties of operations and then use the properties of exponents to more fluently perform the calculations involved rather than rely heavily on a calculator. In particular, teachers could encourage students to estimate the ratios of the two masses before resorting to calculator use.\nThis task provides an opportunity to discuss the accuracy of these calculations and an appropriate level of precision. For example, it is obviously not possible to count the total number of ants in the world at any given moment, nor is it feasible to weigh every adult human. Similarly, the numbers in the task statement make heavy use of "averages" (implicit and unstated is that these averages are mean values, bringing an opportunity to discuss precision in mathematical terminology), a process which inherently raises questions -- were children included in the average human mass calculation? How would their exclusion affect the conclusion? Questions of this form abound, and their analysis fosters critical thinking skills.\nSolutions\nSolution:\n1\nWe are told the total number of ants in the world is about 10,000 trillion or \\(10,000 \\times 10^{12} = 10^4 \\times 10^{12} = 10^{16}\\) ants. In addition, the average mass of a single ant is \\(4 \\times 10^{-3}\\) grams. Thus, the approximate total mass of all ants in the world is $$ \\left( 4 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{g} \\right) \\left(10^{16}\\right) = 4 \\times 10^{-3+16} \\text{g} = 4 \\times 10^{13} \\text{g.}$$\nThe mass for humans is given in kilograms while the mass for ants is in grams. We convert the unit of mass for a human to grams as follows, $$\\left(65 \\text{kg}\\right) \\left(\\frac{10^3 \\text{g}}{1 \\text{kg}} \\right) = \\left( 65 \\times 10^3 \\right) \\text{g} = \\left(6.5 \\times 10^1 \\right) \\left(10^3 \\right) \\text{g} = 6.5 \\times 10^{1+3} \\text{g} = 6.5 \\times 10^4 \\text{g.}$$ Since there are 6.84 billion humans on earth, the total mass of all humans on earth can be approximated as\n\\begin{align} \\left( 6.5 \\times 10^4 \\text{g} \\right) \\left(6.84 \\ \\text{billion} \\right) &= \\left( 6.5 \\times 10^4 \\text{g} \\right) \\left(6.84 \\times 10^9 \\right)\\\\ &= \\left( 6.5 \\times 6.84 \\right) \\left(10^4 \\times 10^9 \\right) \\text{g}\\\\ &= 44.46 \\times 10^{4+9} \\text{g}\\\\ &= \\left(4.446 \\times 10^1\\right) \\times 10^{13} \\text{g}\\\\ &= 4.446 \\times 10^{14} \\text{g.} \\end{align}\nThus, the total mass of all humans in the world is greater than the total mass of all ants in the world. In fact, the calculations above show the total mass of all humans in the world is about 10 times the total mass of all ants.\nAnts versus humans\nby\nillustrativemathematics\n, used under\nCC-BY-NC-SA 3.0\nAdd new\nAdd an OpenCurriculum resource\nAdd / remove standards', 'image_urls': [], 'title': '8.EE Ants versus humans  ‹ OpenCurriculum'}, {'url': 'https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/ants-how-many-number-earth-planet-population-humans-rcna48534', 'raw_content': 'Earth\'s ant population of 20 quadrillion outnumbers humans by 2.5 million times, study says\nIE 11 is not supported.

The research could help scientists understand the role that ants play in ecosystems and provide a way to assess how these insects and others are\naffected by threats such as climate change\n.\n"Our results provide a crucial baseline for exploring environmental drivers of ant-abundance patterns and for tracking the responses of insects to environmental change," the scientists wrote in the study, which was published Monday in the\njournal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\n.\nThe study also estimated that the total mass of ants on the planet works out to roughly 12 megatons of dry carbon, a huge sum that hints at their ubiquity, said Mark Wong, a Forrest Fellow in the School of Biological Sciences at the University of Western Australia.\nTaken together, the total mass of ants on the planet would actually outweigh all of the world’s wild birds and mammals, he added.\n"We found that there are literally tons of ants on Earth, which really underscores their ecological value," Wong\nsaid in a statement\n.\nJorge Villalba / Getty Images / iStockphoto\nAnts can be found in nearly all habitats except for polar regions, according to the study. Forests and arid parts of the planet had the most ant specimens, while tropical zones had the highest density of ant populations, the researchers found.\n"Our results show that the numbers of ants are highest in the tropics, which include areas facing some of the strongest pressures from human disturbances and environmental change," Wong said in the statement.\nThe scientists called the new estimate conservative and said more research is needed to assess the role that ants play in their terrestrial ecosystems.\n"Per hectare, ants move up to 13 tons of soil mass per year," study lead author Patrick Schultheiss, a biologist at the University of Würzburg in Germany,\nsaid in a statement\n. As such, "they have a great influence on maintaining the nutrient cycle and also play a decisive role in the distribution of plant seeds."\nPrevious studies have had worrying outlooks for the world\'s insect populations. A series of studies published in January 2021 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences\xa0found that climate change, invasive species, light pollution, changes in agriculture and the use of insecticides and herbicides are collectively causing the\nloss of around 1% to 2% of Earth\'s insects each year\n.\nA separate study published in April 2020 in the journal Science found that the planet has\nlost more than one-quarter of its land-dwelling insects in the past 30 years\n.\n"Ants provide key ecological services — not only in natural systems but also in our farms, plantations, parks and cities — so it is in our best interest to monitor populations and investigate how they are responding to warming climates," Wong said.\nDenise Chow\nDenise Chow is a science and space reporter for NBC News.', 'image_urls': [{'url': 'https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-560w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-09/220920-ant-mn-1110-353b8a.jpg', 'score': 3}, {'url': 'https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-09/220920-ants-mn-1115-6641c6.jpg', 'score': 3}], 'title': "Earth's ant population of 20 quadrillion outnumbers humans by 2.5 million times, study says"}, {'url': 'https://medium.com/@ThomasCrane/the-mighty-ants-a-surprising-revelation-of-earths-weighty-inhabitants-d87bac1ac84d', 'raw_content': 'The Mighty Ants: A Surprising Revelation of Earth’s Weighty Inhabitants | by Thomas Crane | Medium\nOpen in app\nSign up\nSign in\nWrite\nSign up\nSign in\nThe Mighty Ants: A Surprising Revelation of Earth’s Weighty Inhabitants\nThomas Crane\n·\nFollow\n4 min read\n·\nJul 26, 2023\n--\nListen\nShare\nIn the vast realm of Earth’s biodiversity, ants stand as one of the most astonishing and abundant creatures. Despite their tiny size, their collective presence leaves a profound impact on the planet. A mind-boggling fact reveals that the weight of all the ants inhabiting Earth is greater than the total weight of all human beings combined. This revelation presents a remarkable insight into the immense significance of these diminutive insects and highlights the interconnectedness of all life forms on our planet.\nThe Remarkable World of Ants\nAnts, the social insects belonging to the Formicidae family, comprise an astounding diversity of species, with over 12,000 identified worldwide. Their habitats range from scorching deserts to dense forests and bustling urban areas. Each ant species exhibits remarkable adaptations and behaviors that enable them to thrive in their respective environments.\nAnts live in highly structured colonies, each consisting of thousands to millions of individuals, where they divide labor, communicate through pheromones, and maintain complex social hierarchies. The astonishing ability of ants to work together and synchronize their actions is a testament to the power of collective effort and cooperation in the natural world.\nWeighing the Ants: A Startling Revelation\nThe concept that the combined weight of all the ants on Earth surpasses the weight of all humans might seem implausible at first. However, this phenomenon is rooted in the sheer number of ants and their efficient organization in colonies.\nTo estimate the total weight of ants, researchers have analyzed ant populations in various regions and extrapolated the data to encompass the entire planet. The calculations consider factors such as the average weight of an individual ant, the number of ants per colony, and the approximate number of ant colonies worldwide.\nThe results of these estimates are staggering. It is believed that the total weight of ants on Earth is around 3 to 4 times greater than the weight of all human beings combined. While humans are undoubtedly larger and possess greater physical mass individually, the collective presence of ants far outweighs our combined biomass.\nThe Ecological Impact of Ants\nAnts have a profound ecological impact on the ecosystems they inhabit. As scavengers, they play a crucial role in decomposition, breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients back into the environment. Additionally, many ant species are predatory, preying on smaller insects and invertebrates, thus controlling their populations and maintaining ecological balance.\nMoreover, ants are highly effective seed dispersers. They collect seeds from plants and disperse them across the landscape as they move between their nests and foraging sites. This activity promotes plant diversity and ensures the survival and expansion of various plant species.\nIn certain regions, ants even act as ecosystem engineers by constructing elaborate nests that modify soil structure, water retention, and nutrient distribution. These modifications can influence the growth of plants and provide shelter for other organisms.\nThe Earth’s Oceans: Nature’s Enormous Underwater Museum\nThe Earth’s oceans have always been a mysterious realm, captivating the human imagination with their vastness and…\nmedium.com\nThe Ant-Human Comparison: Lessons Learned\nComparing the weight of ants to that of humans may be a humbling realization for our species. It serves as a reminder that size and physical strength are not the only metrics of importance in the natural world. Ants demonstrate the power of collective intelligence, teamwork, and adaptability.\nObserving how ants function as a cohesive unit, working together for the greater good of the colony, presents valuable lessons for humanity. Cooperation, communication, and division of labor have allowed ants to survive and thrive for millions of years, and these qualities could serve as an inspiration for human societies to address global challenges.\nAnthropomorphism and the Ant World\nDespite their incredible abilities, ants often go unnoticed and unappreciated by humans. Anthropomorphism, the attribution of human-like characteristics to non-human entities, frequently influences the way we perceive and interact with other species. When it comes to ants, their small size and sheer numbers often lead us to overlook their intricate social structures and capabilities.\nBy acknowledging and understanding the complex world of ants, we can develop a greater appreciation for the diversity of life on Earth and foster a sense of interconnectedness with all living beings.\nConservation Implications\nThe staggering weight of ants on Earth should serve as a reminder of the importance of conserving all forms of life, no matter their size. As habitats continue to be threatened by human activities, it is essential to recognize the significance of each species in maintaining ecological balance.\nAnts, as ecosystem engineers and key contributors to nutrient cycling, are essential for the health and resilience of many ecosystems. Preserving their habitats and the biodiversity they support is crucial for the long-term sustainability of our planet.\nConclusion\nThe revelation that the collective weight of all the ants on Earth surpasses that of all humans combined is a remarkable fact that highlights the wonders of the natural world. It reminds us of the intricate web of life and the significant role each species plays in maintaining the balance of ecosystems.\nAnts, despite their small size, have a colossal impact on the planet. Their cooperative behavior, adaptability, and ecological contributions hold valuable lessons for human societies. By understanding and appreciating these fascinating creatures, we can gain insights into the importance of preserving biodiversity and working together to ensure a sustainable future for all life on Earth.\nIf you enjoyed what you read, I encourage you to follow along for more captivating content.\nTogether, we can continue to explore, learn, and engage in the topics that intrigue us.\nThank you once again for being a part of this journey.\nAnts\nEco\nFacts\nKnowledge\nEarth\nFollow\nWritten by\nThomas Crane\n80 Followers\n·\n106 Following\nI am a part-time writer and I strive to empower others whether through personal essays or captivating fiction and motivate those who engage with them.\nFollow\nNo responses yet\nHelp\nStatus\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nBlog\nPrivacy\nTerms\nText to speech\nTeams', 'image_urls': [], 'title': 'The Mighty Ants: A Surprising Revelation of Earth’s Weighty Inhabitants | by Thomas Crane | Medium'}]
