The world's human population is forecast to surpass 8 billion in the coming months. Compared to ants, that is a mediocre milestone.
Researchers have made the most thorough assessment to date of the global population of ants - insects that have colonised almost everywhere on the planet - and the estimated total is a mind-blowing 20 quadrillion of them, or approximately 2.5 million for every human.
It should come as little surprise considering how ubiquitous these busy and social insects are and the fact that they have thrived since the age of dinosaurs, with the oldest-known ant fossil dating back about 100 million years to the Cretaceous Period.

While we have all wondered how many Ants are there on Earth, Scientists now have an estimate and it's mind-boggling. A
new study
puts the number to be around 20 quadrillion ants on Earth, roughly around 2.5 million ants for every human.

Content: “Anyone who’s looked at ants and realized there are lots of them has probably wondered how many there may be in total – it’s just a question that’s on people’s minds,” says Patrick Schultheiss at the University of Hong Kong, who co-led the study with his colleague Sabine Nooten at the Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg in Germany.
The research was based on 489 studies, spanning all continents, biomes, and habitats. Using this data, the researchers estimated the total number of ants to be 20 quadrillions.
The total biomass of this global ant population – the collective weight of carbon in all individuals – is about 12 million tonnes. This is more than wild birds and mammals combined, which have total biomass of 2 million tonnes and 7 million tonnes, respectively. Humans, by comparison, have total biomass of 60 million tonnes.

Content: "Our dataset represents a massive collecting effort of thousands of scientists. We were then able to extrapolate the number of ants for different regions of the world and estimate their total global number and biomass," Schultheiss said.
Tropical regions were found to harbour many more ants than other regions, with forests and drylands boasting more ants than urban areas.
"There are certain parts of the world where we have little data and we cannot reach reliable estimates for all continents. Africa is one such example. We have long known that it is a very ant-rich continent but also very under-studied," Schultheiss said.
Ants generally live in colonies, sometimes consisting of millions of them divided into groups with different roles such as workers, soldiers, and queens. The workers, all females, care for the bigger queen and her offspring, maintain the nest, and forage for food. Males mate with queens, then die.

Content: Ants, whose closest relatives are bees and wasps, are native to nearly everywhere on Earth, as any picnicker knows, except Antarctica, Greenland, Iceland and some island nations.
"I was amazed that the ants' biomass was higher than that of wild mammals and birds combined, and that it reaches 20 percent of the human biomass. That gives you an understanding of the scale of their impact," said insect ecologist and study co-lead author Sabine Nooten, also of the University of Würzburg and University of Hong Kong.
"I find the enormous diversity of ants fascinating. They can be tiny or huge and show the most bizarre adaptations," Nooten added, citing a widespread ant genus called Strumigenys, known for long mouthparts with spikes used to hunt small invertebrates.
The researchers based their analysis on 489 studies of ant populations spanning every continent where ants live.

Content: The researchers noted that the abundances of ground-dwelling ants are strongly concentrated in tropical and subtropical regions but vary substantially across habitats. The density of leaf-litter ants is highest in forests, while the numbers of actively ground-foraging ants are highest in arid regions.
Previous estimates of the number of ants on Earth were “essentially educated guesses” that extrapolated from ant densities measured in one or two locations, says Schultheiss. The latest analysis aimed to be more accurate by looking at studies from all continents and written in different languages.
"Our results provide a crucial baseline for exploring environmental drivers of ant-abundance patterns and for tracking the responses of insects to environmental change."

Title: INSTITUTE OF ENTOMOLOGY | How many ants live in the world? And are all the ants as heavy as the humankind?
Content: A recent study in the prestigious American journal PNAS by Schultheiss and colleagues has refined estimates of how many ants live in the world and how much they weigh. It estimated that they are approximately 2.5 million worker ants for every human, and all of the ants in the world weigh as much as a fifth of the human population on Earth. The study was followed up by a comment in the same journal by researchers Tom Fayle and Petr Klimeš from the Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences (BC CAS), who introduced how estimates of the abundance and biomass (carbon weight) of ants have changed over time, and pointed out that we still do not know the abundance of insects as a whole. Ants are thus one of the few invertebrates for which new research has made such estimates possible. However, according to Fayle and Klimeš, we still have to wait for more accurate numbers, and it is likely that ant numbers and biomass are even larger.

Content: We will have to wait for more accurate estimates. However, it is already apparent and somewhat alarming that neither ants (range of all estimates 3.6 – 50 Mt) nor humans (60 Mt) achieve such huge biomass weights as domestic animals (100 Mt carbon). Even so, the weight of ants and humans far exceeds the weight of, for example, all wild birds (

). The next step in today's rapidly changing world is thus a deeper understanding of how the abundance and biomass of insects and other organisms differ between natural and altered landscapes.
Many species of ants show polymorphism in the body size of workers. An extreme case is in the genus

Thus, the total mass of all humans in the world is greater than the total mass of all ants in the world. In fact, the calculations above show the total mass of all humans in the world is about 10 times the total mass of all ants.

individuals, but the reliability of this estimate cannot yet be empirically verified. Nevertheless, the question remained of whether we can refine our abundance estimates for at least some groups of insects. Ants - a socially living and ecologically significant group - belong to the most prominent representatives of insects with large populations. And it was this group of insects who were made famous by biologist Edward O. Wilson, who compared their weight to the weight of all the humans. However, this consideration, like all previous studies, was based on the rough estimate of the total number of insects. Schultheiss et al. for the first time based their calculations on actual measured numbers of ant workers in leaf-litter, collected from hundreds of studies from most habitats of the world. This most recent work estimated the total population of worker ants at 2 × 10
16
(20 quadrillion), equivalent to 20% of current human biomass (

We are told the total number of ants in the world is about 10,000 trillion or \(10,000 \times 10^{12} = 10^4 \times 10^{12} = 10^{16}\) ants. In addition, the average mass of a single ant is \(4 \times 10^{-3}\) grams. Thus, the approximate total mass of all ants in the world is $$ \left( 4 \times 10^{-3} \text{g} \right) \left(10^{16}\right) = 4 \times 10^{-3+16} \text{g} = 4 \times 10^{13} \text{g.}$$
The mass for humans is given in kilograms while the mass for ants is in grams. We convert the unit of mass for a human to grams as follows, $$\left(65 \text{kg}\right) \left(\frac{10^3 \text{g}}{1 \text{kg}} \right) = \left( 65 \times 10^3 \right) \text{g} = \left(6.5 \times 10^1 \right) \left(10^3 \right) \text{g} = 6.5 \times 10^{1+3} \text{g} = 6.5 \times 10^4 \text{g.}$$ Since there are 6.84 billion humans on earth, the total mass of all humans on earth can be approximated as

Content: But is it possible that the ant abundance and biomass is greater and Wilson was not mistaken in his rough estimate? Tom Fayle and Petr Klimeš point out that these new estimates do not take into account species living in the soil and ant queens and brood. It is also not clear how the current estimates would change if differences in the weight of individual ants between different species could be taken into account in future calculations, rather than just using an estimate of the weight of the average ant. Ant species vary dramatically in body size and for many species this is true even within a single colony. Similarly, the colonies themselves vary in size, but their numbers are largely unknown. While counting individual ants in leaf-litter has proven feasible, counting nests on a global scale is not yet possible. The total biomass of ants is thus probably even greater. On the other hand, it is likely that current calculations, on the contrary, overestimate the number of ants in some

To say that ants outnumber people on Earth would be a gross understatement. According to a new study, there are estimated to be 2.5 million times more ants on this planet than people.
In total, that's 20 quadrillion — or 20,000,000,000,000,000 — ants.
A team of researchers from Australia, Germany and Hong Kong analyzed 489 studies that gathered data on ground- and tree-dwelling ants in different habitats across all continents to come up with the mind-bending estimate. The research could help scientists understand the role that ants play in ecosystems and provide a way to assess how these insects and others are

Ants can be found in nearly all habitats except for polar regions, according to the study. Forests and arid parts of the planet had the most ant specimens, while tropical zones had the highest density of ant populations, the researchers found.
"Our results show that the numbers of ants are highest in the tropics, which include areas facing some of the strongest pressures from human disturbances and environmental change," Wong said in the statement.
The scientists called the new estimate conservative and said more research is needed to assess the role that ants play in their terrestrial ecosystems.
"Per hectare, ants move up to 13 tons of soil mass per year," study lead author Patrick Schultheiss, a biologist at the University of Würzburg in Germany,
said in a statement
. As such, "they have a great influence on maintaining the nutrient cycle and also play a decisive role in the distribution of plant seeds."

Content: Previous studies have had worrying outlooks for the world's insect populations. A series of studies published in January 2021 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences found that climate change, invasive species, light pollution, changes in agriculture and the use of insecticides and herbicides are collectively causing the
loss of around 1% to 2% of Earth's insects each year
.
A separate study published in April 2020 in the journal Science found that the planet has
lost more than one-quarter of its land-dwelling insects in the past 30 years
.
"Ants provide key ecological services — not only in natural systems but also in our farms, plantations, parks and cities — so it is in our best interest to monitor populations and investigate how they are responding to warming climates," Wong said.

All the ants on Earth weigh about as much as all the humans.
Ants, these tiny creatures that are often seen as a nuisance, play a significant role in the overall weight of living organisms on our planet. Surprisingly, the combined weight of all the ants on Earth is about equal to the weight of all the humans. This intriguing fact highlights the incredible numbers and remarkable capabilities of these minuscule insects.

"If we were to weigh all the ants in the world, they would weigh as much as all of the people," said wildlife presenter Chris Packham recently in BBC Four's The Wonder Of Animals: Ants. But is this statement true?
This claim was originally made by Harvard University professor Edward O Wilson, and the German biologist Bert Hoelldobler, in their 1994 book Journey To The Ants.
They based their estimate on an earlier one by British entomologist C B Williams, who once calculated that the number or insects alive on earth at a given moment was one million trillion.
"If, to take a conservative figure, one percent of this host is ants, their total population is ten thousand trillion," wrote Wilson and Hoelldobler. "Individual workers weigh on average between 1 to 5 mg, according to the species. When combined, all ants in the world taken together weigh about as much as all human beings."

Content: Ants are also proficient agriculturalists. Certain species cultivate fungus as their primary food source, effectively creating their miniature farms. They forage for plant material, bring it back to their colonies, and use it to cultivate fungus gardens. In some instances, ants even rear aphids, protecting and milking them for the sugary secretions they produce.
In conclusion, the fact that all the ants on Earth weigh about as much as all the humans is a testament to both the astonishing numbers and the immense contributions of ants to our planet. These tiny creatures, despite their size, play a crucial role in ecosystems, maintaining balance and aiding in the process of decomposition. So, the next time you spot an ant scurrying across the ground, remember the extraordinary weight they collectively hold on Earth.

Content: Even by Wilson and Hoelldobler's own figures, their calculation is wrong. There are 7.2 billion humans on the planet today - if we take everyone over the age of 15, they weigh a combined total of about 332bn kg. If we imagine there are 10,000 trillion ants in the world, weighing an average of 4mg, their total weight comes to just 40bn kg.
If we allow for the smaller human population at the time they wrote their book, and a slightly lower average weight, they are still a long way out.
But Ratnieks believes Wilson and Hoelldobler's claim - though untrue in relation to today's world population - would have once been accurate.
"I think if we went back 2,000 years, certainly the ants would've outweighed the humans... but at roughly the time that America became independent [1776], or a little bit before that, that's when we humans became more impressive in our weight than the ants," he says.

Content: Another option is to weigh them in a group, says Mike Fox from BWARS: "I would simply take a suitable container such as a specimen tube and weigh it empty, then put in a counted number of ants, say 100. Weigh again. Deduct the weight of the empty tube and divide it by the number of ants."

With around 13,000 species worldwide, ranging in length from less than 1mm to 30mm, it's probable their weights vary greatly - though most experts seem to agree the average weight of an ant is less than 10mg.
But no-one knows how many ants there are in the world. The BBC Four documentary claims they number not 10,000 trillion but 100 trillion, though it still suggests the total weight of ants equals the total weight of humans.
Experts from the Natural History Museum, Bristol University's Ant Lab, and BWARS (Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society), among others, say there is no realistic estimate.

Researchers have worked out an estimate for the number of
ants crawling
around Earth — and the total is "astounding."
Scientists at the
University of Hong Kong
say there are 20,000,000,000,000,000 — that's 20 quadrillion — of the critters around the globe. The combined weight of those ants is more than all of the wild birds and mammals on the planet.
The weight is also equal to about one-fifth of the total weight of humans. Scientists say the findings,
published
Monday in the peer-reviewed Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, are "conservative."

Title: Earth harbours 20,000,000,000,000,000 ants – and they weigh more than wild birds and mammals combined
Content: Our
research
published today provides an approximate answer. We conservatively estimate our planet harbours about 20 quadrillion ants. That’s 20 thousand million millions, or in numerical form, 20,000,000,000,000,000 (20 with 15 zeroes).
We further estimate the world’s ants collectively constitute about 12 million tonnes of dry carbon. This exceeds the mass of all the world’s wild birds and wild mammals combined. It’s also equal to about one-fifth of the total weight of humans.
Eminent biologist Edward O. Wilson once said insects and other invertebrates are “the little things that run the world” – and he was right. Ants, in particular, are a crucial
part
of nature. Among other roles, ants aerate the soil, disperse seeds, break down organic material, create habitat for other animals and form an important part of the food chain.
Estimating ant numbers and mass provides an important baseline from which to monitor ant populations amid worrying environmental changes.

Title: Are all the ants as heavy as all the humans? - BBC News
Content: Wilson and Hoelldobler's calculation is based on the idea that the average human weighs a million times more than the average ant. So how well does that stand up to scrutiny? The average adult human weighs 62kg, so that would make the average ant about 60mg.
"There are ants that weigh 60mg, but they're really the big ants," says Francis Ratnieks, Professor of Apiculture at the University of Sussex.
"The common ants which live in British gardens weigh about 1mg or 2mg."

"It's very easy to weigh an ant. You buy a small electronic balance, and you place the ant on the balance," says Ratnieks. But he advises you refrigerate it first. "That way it doesn't run away."

Title: Earth harbours 20,000,000,000,000,000 ants – and they weigh more than wild birds and mammals combined
Content: typically measured
in terms of their carbon makeup. We estimated that 20 quadrillion average-sized ants corresponds to a dry weight or “biomass” of approximately 12 million tonnes of carbon.
This is more than the combined biomass of wild birds and mammals – and about 20% of total human biomass.
Carbon makes up
about half
the dry weight of an ant. If the weight of other bodily elements was included, the total mass of the world’s ants would be higher still.
We also found ants are distributed unevenly on Earth’s surface. They vary sixfold between habitats and generally peak in the tropics. This underscores the importance of tropical regions in maintaining healthy ant populations.
Ants were also particularly abundant in forests, and surprisingly, in arid regions. But they become less common in human-made habitats.

Title: All the ants on earth weigh about as much as all the humans | The Fact Base
Content: Ants, belonging to the insect order Hymenoptera, have a global distribution and can be found in almost every ecosystem on Earth. With over 12,000 known species, ants have successfully colonized various habitats, from deserts to rainforests and from cities to remote islands. They are highly social insects, living in large colonies with complex social structures.
Due to their small size, ants may not individually weigh much, but their sheer numbers make a significant impact. Estimates suggest that there are trillions upon trillions of ants on Earth, with some studies suggesting that the number could potentially reach one million ants per human. This massive population contributes to the overall weight of ants, making it equal to the weight of mankind.

The concept that the combined weight of all the ants on Earth surpasses the weight of all humans might seem implausible at first. However, this phenomenon is rooted in the sheer number of ants and their efficient organization in colonies.
To estimate the total weight of ants, researchers have analyzed ant populations in various regions and extrapolated the data to encompass the entire planet. The calculations consider factors such as the average weight of an individual ant, the number of ants per colony, and the approximate number of ant colonies worldwide.
The results of these estimates are staggering. It is believed that the total weight of ants on Earth is around 3 to 4 times greater than the weight of all human beings combined. While humans are undoubtedly larger and possess greater physical mass individually, the collective presence of ants far outweighs our combined biomass.

Content: The Ecological Impact of Ants
Ants have a profound ecological impact on the ecosystems they inhabit. As scavengers, they play a crucial role in decomposition, breaking down organic matter and recycling nutrients back into the environment. Additionally, many ant species are predatory, preying on smaller insects and invertebrates, thus controlling their populations and maintaining ecological balance.
Moreover, ants are highly effective seed dispersers. They collect seeds from plants and disperse them across the landscape as they move between their nests and foraging sites. This activity promotes plant diversity and ensures the survival and expansion of various plant species.
In certain regions, ants even act as ecosystem engineers by constructing elaborate nests that modify soil structure, water retention, and nutrient distribution. These modifications can influence the growth of plants and provide shelter for other organisms.
